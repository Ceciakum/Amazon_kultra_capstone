# Amazon_kultra_capstone# ðŸ“Š My Data Analysis Capstone Project

This project includes two case studies I worked on as part of my final capstone:

 1. Amazon Product Review (Excel)
I cleaned the product data, created pivot tables, and built a dashboard in Excel.  
Some of the things I looked at:
- Average discounts by category
- Top-rated products
- How discounts relate to product ratings
- Product review counts and price ranges

 2. Kultra Mega Stores (SQL)
I used SQL Server to run queries and analyze the sales and shipping data.  
Some things I worked on:
- Total sales by product and region
- Shipping cost by method
- How shipping method relates to order priority

 Whatâ€™s in this folder:
- `Amazon_Case_Study.xlsx` â€“ My cleaned Excel data and dashboard
- `kultra_queries.sql` â€“ My SQL queries
- `SQL_Insights.md` â€“ A short summary of my findings from the SQL work

Thanks for checking out my work!
